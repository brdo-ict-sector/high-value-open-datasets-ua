**High-Value Datasets (HVDS) Publication Analysis for Ukraine's Open Data Portal**
This repository contains an analysis of the publication status of 82 High-Value Datasets (HVDS) mandated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Resolution No. 835 (as amended in September 2025).

HVDS are key public data sets critical for societal, economic, and environmental development.

Key Findings:
- Overall Publication Status: 74.4% of the required 82 datasets have been published.
- Timeliness Issue: Only 34.1% of the datasets are reported as being updated on time.
- Format Quality: While 69.2% of resources are structured (XLS(X), CSV, API), a significant portion uses hard-to-process unstructured formats (12.5%) like DOC and PDF, hindering machine readability.
- Non-Compliant Entities: 10 organizations, including the Main Service Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and the National Police of Ukraine, have published zero of their required HVDS.

This analysis tracks compliance, highlights data quality issues, and promotes the availability of critical public information.
